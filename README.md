<h1>UBlock - Redirect Your Focus</h1>

This technical capstone set out to design and implement a more effective iPhone application that reduces users’ overall screen time. Using Apple’s IDE (Xcode & SwiftUI) and Screen Time API, a minimum viable product (UBlock) was developed allowing users to select distracting apps, block them during specified hours, and record productive alternatives. This project serves as an important step towards a much larger and more sophisticated tool, and its successful development means it can now be distributed and used by users to reduce their screen times.
