<h3>Summary</h3>
UBlock is an iOS app that allows users to select distracting apps they find, block them during specified hours, and record ideas for productive activities that they would rather dedicate their time to.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
A vast majority of young Americans report that they believe they spend too much time using their smartphones. On iPhone, Apple provides the Screen Time app and third-party apps via the App Store to help users set app time limits - however, existing solutions are unsatisfactory due to the minimal friction they provide in accessing distracting apps and the easy workarounds that are built into these limits.
This technical capstone set out to design and implement a more effective iPhone application that helps user’s reduce overall screen time.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
Developed using Apple’s IDE (Xcode & SwiftUI) and Screen Time API, this minimum viable product was developed allowing users to select distracting apps, block them during specified hours, and record productive alternatives. This project serves as an important step towards a much larger and more sophisticated tool, and its successful development means it can now be distributed and used by users to reduce their screen times.

<h3>Skills Developed</h3>

- Developed an iOS mobile application using Xcode, Swift, SwiftUI, and SwiftData

- Integrated Apple’s Screen Time API using Family Controls, Managed Settings, and Device Activity frameworks

- Implemented app blocking schedules and App Shield overlays to restrict distracting apps during specified hours

- Built UI sheets and configuration workflows for selecting distracting apps, entering productive goals, and setting schedules

- Used data persistence to retain user selections and configurations across app launches

- Conducted customer discovery interviews (23–26 participants) to inform requirements and core feature priorities

- Performed competitive analysis of existing screen time solutions (e.g., Opal, one sec) to identify shortcomings

- Adapted scope based on technical constraints (e.g., sandbox limitations preventing leaderboard implementation)
